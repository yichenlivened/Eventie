# Eventie 
Eventie is a Meet-Up Event Planner with a focus on high conversion web forms - account creation, event creation and event display.

## Technology stack
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Firebase

## Features
- **Responsiveness:** Content is responsive and presents all information clearly on a variety of devices (including desktop, tablet, and mobile).

- **Prompts:** Most form prompts (including labels, placeholders, etc) are designed for users and their goals - they are phrased in friendly, human language.

- **Simplified Design:** There are as few inputs as possible.

- **Validation:** Users cannot submit a form with invalid information. Validation occurs no later than immediately after user focus leaves the input and is obvious.


## Install
```
gulp

gulp build

gulp serve:dist
```
